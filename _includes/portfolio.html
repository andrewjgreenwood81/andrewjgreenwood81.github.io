<p>My last major project at Raven Software, where I was instrumental in the development and launch of a highly successful feature for Call of Duty: Warzone—the Look For Party System.</p>

<p>I led prototyping through to the live implementation and maintenance phases. It was received enthusiastically and ported to the other Call Of Duty titles at that time.</p>

<p>Due to over-allocated resources, I took on full-stack responsibilities, handling the front, middle, and back ends of the feature while also contributing to the design. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-warzone-new-map-al-mazrah-gulag-dmz-intel">More Details</a></p>

<p>Working on Call of Duty: Warzone was undoubtedly one of the highlights of my career so far. The game’s first year live was an amazing time playing with friends after work and updating the game every day.</p>

<p>As the longest-serving and, at times, the sole UI engineer on Warzone 1, I was involved from prototyping all the way through to sunsetting, over a span of four years. This journey provided countless learning opportunities and was incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite contributions to the project include developing the Contract system and creating a new splash system for the in-game HUD, and assisting in setting up the Plunder UI and game scripts. <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Warzone">More Details</a></p>

<p>My first project at Raven Software was a remarkable. Our team consisted mostly of newcomers to AAA development, but we were fortunate to have two outstanding senior developers guiding and training us.</p>

<p>Being a relatively fresh team, it was an incredible honor to be called Best Remaster by IGN. The user interface was the most stable and user-friendly I’ve ever worked on, and the game shipped with very few bugs. <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_Remastered">More Details</a></p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed working on this game, particularly because we programmed a functioning Mendelian evolution system that could be triggered mid-quest to have the world respond to player actions and scripted plot developments. This added a unique depth to the game. I tested, debugged, and fixed quests on top of my UI and Gameplay programming work.</p>

<p>This was also my first experience working on an MMO, making the network side of development incredibly fascinating. Initially, I was part of a two-person engineering team, but I eventually took the reins solo after launch, managing updates and maintenance.</p>

<p>This project provided my first opportunity to program an inventory GUI. It was a cool challenge to create something I had used for decades in games like WoW and other titles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@radixendeavor">More Details</a></p>

<p>As the sole programmer on this project, I was very happy with the result. I contributed to the game design and worked with an amazing team.</p>

<p>One highlight was programming the weather system and Doppler radar mode. Balancing visual appeal with efficiency was challenging but rewarding. It ran smoothly on tablets and accurately mapped in-game weather and severe storm gameplay elements.</p>

<p>Additionally, programming the analog tools’ behaviors and data was a lot of fun. <a href="https://ssec.si.edu/disaster-detector">More Details</a></p>

<p>I contributed significantly to quality-of-life updates for these educational games and programmed a few new ones. Features like a working mute button were essential for classroom use.</p>

<p>Programming games designed to teach kids about civics was a learning experience for me as well, I didn’t know how much I didn’t know about how our governments work. <a href="https://ed.icivics.org/games">More Details</a></p>

<p>One of my first professionally paid programming projects involved engineering significant post-launch updates to the game. A lot of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. <a href="https://www.filamentgames.com/project/reach-for-the-sun/">More Details</a></p>
