Hello, I'm Andrew Greenwood. Well, I'm a website.
Well technically I am some text inside Visual Studio Code,
that turns into a website and Andrew is the one typing.
Please look at my work and contact me about a job.
I like working: solo, and on teams.
I can do a lot of stuff, just ask.
My most famous work was being one of the main
user interface programmers on Call of Duty: Warzone.
That was a nice time.
