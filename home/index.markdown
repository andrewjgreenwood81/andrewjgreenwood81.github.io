Welcome to my portfolio site. Here, you'll find a showcase of my work as a user interface and game programmer, including my most notable project: Call of Duty: Warzone.

I'm passionate about creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. Whether working solo or as part of a dynamic team, I bring a versatile skill set and a commitment to excellence. I have experience with a wide range of tools and languages, including Objective C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Actionscript, Unity, Flash, Cocos2D, HTML5, Ajax, QBasic, Python, and more.

I've successfully delivered projects for various platforms, such as CD-ROM, Web, iOS (iPhone and iPad), Android, VR, PC, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation. If it involves loops, conditionals, and math functions, I can help create a game or app with it. While I have yet to work professionally with Unreal Engine, I'm eager to learn and add it to my skill set.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you're interested in discussing job opportunities or collaborations. I look forward to connecting with you!
